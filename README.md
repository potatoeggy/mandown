Mandown is a comic downloader and a CBZ, EPUB, MOBI, and/or PDF converter. It also supports image post-processing to make them more readable on certain devices similarly to [Kindle Comic Converter](https://github.com/ciromattia/kcc).

## Features

- Download comics from [supported sites](#supported-sites)
  - Supports downloading a range of chapters
  - Supports multithreaded downloading
- Process downloaded images
  - Rotate or split double-page spreads
  - Trim borders
  - Resize images
- Convert downloaded comics to CBZ, EPUB, MOBI, or PDF
  - Convert any other CBZ, EPUB, MOBI, or PDF comic to CBZ, EPUB, MOBI, or PDF
- [A library to easily do all of this from other Python scripts](#basic-library-usage)

## Usage

Run `mandown --help` or see the [docs](/docs/) for more information and examples.

```
mandown get <URL>
```

To convert the downloaded contents to CBZ/EPUB/MOBI/PDF, append the `--convert` option. To apply image processing to the downloaded images, append the `--process` option.

```
mandown get <URL> --convert epub --process rotate_double_pages
```

To download only a certain range of chapters, append the `--start` and/or `--end` options.

> **Note:** `--start` and `--end` are _inclusive_, i.e., using `--start 2 --end 3` will download chapters 2 and 3.

To convert an existing folder or comic file without downloading anything (like a stripped-down version of <https://github.com/ciromattia/kcc>), use the `convert` command.

```
mandown convert <FORMAT> <PATH_TO_COMIC>
```

To process an existing folder without downloading anything, use the `process` command.

```
mandown process <PROCESS_OPERATIONS> <PATH_TO_FOLDER>
```

Where `PROCESS_OPERATIONS` is an option found from running `mandown process --help`.
